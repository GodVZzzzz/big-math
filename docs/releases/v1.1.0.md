# API changes

## New class `BigFloat`

The class `BigFloat` is a wrapper around `BigDecimal` which simplifies the consistent usage of the MathContext and provides a simpler API for calculations. 

## New method `BigDecimalMath.coth()`

The hyperbolic cotangens function `coth()` was added to `BigDecimalMath`.

The signature of the new function is:
```java
public static BigDecimal coth(BigDecimal x, MathContext mathContext)
```

## `BigDecimalMath.Context` removed

The inner class `BigDecimalMath.Context` was removed since it was not very useful and `BigFloat` provides all the functionality in a better and more intuitive way.


# Bugfixes

## javadoc fix in `BigDecimalMath.fractionalPart()`

The javadoc of `BigDecimalMath.fractionalPart()` had copy & paste errors from the `integralPart()` method. 

# Examples

Note: The example code is available on github, but not part of the big-math library.

## ch.obermuhlner.math.big.example.BigFloatExample

A simple example application that shows how to use the `BigFloat` class.  

## ch.obermuhlner.math.big.viewer

The JavaFX Application `ch.obermuhlner.math.big.viewer.GraphApp` is available as an example project that uses the `big-math`library.
