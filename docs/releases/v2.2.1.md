## Concurrency bug in Taylor series based calculations

The code that calculates Taylor series caches the intermediate results
to improve the performance of future calculations of the same Taylor series.

This cache had a bug that would lead to 
`NullPointerException`s or wrong calculation when used in a multi-threaded scenario.

The bug was fixed by synchronizing the access to the cache and other changes to mutable state.

Special thanks to [modestukasai](https://github.com/modestukasai) for reporting and anlyzing the bug.

# Examples

Note: The example code is available on github, but not part of the big-math library.

## Improved performance regression measurements

The `PerformanceRegressionBigDecimalMath` example class was improved and wrapped in
several gradle projects to allow reproducable performance regression measurements
over all releases of `big-math`.
