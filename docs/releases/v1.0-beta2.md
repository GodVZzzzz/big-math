# API changes

## Arguments changed to `root(x, n, mathContext)`

The method `root(n, x, mathContext)` has changed the order of arguments to `root(x, n, mathContext)`.
This is more consistent with the usual signature used for `root()` in other languages and libraries.

Unfortunately the change does not break existing code that uses the older version of `root()`, because both arguments are of the same type.

Please verify all existing calls in your code to `root()` and change the arguments to be correct.

## Added missing functions to `Context`

The `Context` class was inconsistent with many missing functions:
* `log2(BigDecimal)`
* `log10(BigDecimal)`
* `pow(BigDecimal, BigDecimal)`
* `pow(BigDecimal, int)`
* `sinh(BigDecimal)`
* `cosh(BigDecimal)`
* `tanh(BigDecimal)`
* `asinh(BigDecimal)`
* `acosh(BigDecimal)`
* `atanh(BigDecimal)`
* `acoth(BigDecimal)`
* `pi()`
* `e()`
* `bernoulli(n)`

# Bugfixes

## Fix `root(x, n)` for n < 1.0

The calculated root for n < 1.0 was incorrect.

## Javadoc

Javadoc was improved in many places.
